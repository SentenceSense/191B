# Initial tasks
###* Figure out how to implement modules into WordPress
###* Begin work on modules

# Completed
###* We found a way to implement the modules using a WordPress plugin
Will try to find a better way of doing this because this method is too dependent on the plugin
###* Made progress on module E-2
Has a button that when pressed reveals the plant visualization growing (still much work to be done)

# Not completed
