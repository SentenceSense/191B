###Testing Plan

Part I:  Software Testing Plan

“This document describes the scope, approach, resources and schedule of intended test activities. It identifies amongst others test items, the features to be tested, the testing tasks, who will do each task, degree of tester independence, the test environment, the test design techniques and entry and exit criteria to be used, and the rationale for their choice,and any risks requiring contingency planning. It is a record of the test planning process.” From "Test Plan | Software Testing Fundamentals." 2011. 27 Sep. 2012 <http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/test-plan/>

#Introduction:

-Provide an overview of the test plan.

+Test to see if users are able to go to the chapters that they want
+Test to see if all the games work
+Test to see if all the button works in the navigation bar
+Test to see if the website can be shown on any web browser
+Test to see if the website can be shown on any device(such as tablets, smart phones and laptop computers)
--How do interactive modules work in devices other than laptops? Touch interface works with modules?

-Specify the goals/objectives.

+Users are able to view the website and conect to any page and chapter that they want
+Users are able to go to any page and any chapter directly and easily

-Specify any constraints.

+Games have not been built
+Some content of the chapters is still not provied by the client
+Need time to figure out how Javascript fits into Wordpress

-Assumptions and Dependencies

       -List the assumptions that have been made during the preparation of this plan

       +Users already have experience of using web browser to browse websites

       -List the dependencies.
       +Currently, the HTML snippets plugin for WordPress is a big dependency because without it we wouldn't be able to show the modules within the site.
        We need to figure out a way to insert Javascript modules into the site directly using the html5 canvas element



Test Item Pass/Fail Criteria:

-Specify the criteria that will be used to determine whether each test item (software/product) has passed or failed testing.

+All the buttons on any page of the website should work
+All the games should work
+User won't have any difficulties on exploring

-This should also include the test items. Test cases for, at least, all relevant testing levels should be covered -

       -Unit/Modules Test Suite

       -Integration Test Suite

       -Scenario or Use case based Test Suite

       -System Test Suite



Test Deliverables:

-List test deliverables, and links to them if available, including the following:

       -Test Plan (this document itself)

       -Test Cases

       -Test Scripts

       -Defect/Enhancement Logs

       -Test Reports

 

Part II:  User Testing Plan

 

There are two parts to user testing:  Examining the interface from the point of view of the user, namely Heuristic Evaluation or using the Checklist, and doing actual user testing, with real users either examining the interface or actually trying to get a test-task done.

 

Your plan for HE/Checklist should be preparing the interface materials (mockups, wireframes, GTN) and then having a session with your team going through the tasks one by one examining the points in the Heuristics or the Checklist.  So you need to plan for the materials, having the checklists available, then recording your “findings.”  You then meet to decide what changes to make in the interface and put those on the sprint.

 

For actual user testing, you have to plan for the kind of user you will recruit and how many, when the sessions will be, what tasks you will ask them to do, what interface they will use, how you will record their actions and evaluations (e.g. a quick survey), and when you will take your findings and make changes to the interface.  Those planned design changes appear on a sprint.
