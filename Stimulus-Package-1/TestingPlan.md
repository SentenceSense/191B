# Test Plan

## Part I:  Software Testing Plan 

“This document describes the scope, approach, resources and schedule of intended test activities. It identifies amongst others test items, the features to be tested, the testing tasks, who will do each task, degree of tester independence, the test environment, the test design techniques and entry and exit criteria to be used, and the rationale for their choice,and any risks requiring contingency planning. It is a record of the test planning process.” From "Test Plan | Software Testing Fundamentals." 2011. 27 Sep. 2012 <http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/test-plan/>

#### Revision History (what changed since last time, since this document will continue throughout the project in the following quarters)

-Created for Stimulus Package 1 (November 11, 2014)
 
#### Introduction:

* Test to see if users are able to go to the chapters that they want
* Test to see if all the games work
* Test to see if all the button works in the navigation bar
* Test to see if the website can be shown on any web browser
* Test to see if the website can be shown on any device (such as tablets, smart phones and laptop computers)
  * How do interactive modules work in devices other than laptops? Touch interface works with modules?

##### Specify the goals/objectives.

* Users are able to view the website and connect to any page and chapter that they want
* Users are able to go to any page and any chapter directly and easily
* Users are able to play games without any obvious problems

##### Specify any constraints.

* Developing for a wide range of screens and devices
* Some content of the chapters is still not provied by the client

##### Assumptions and Dependencies

       -Assumptions:

       * Users already have experience using a web browser to browse websites
       * Users can simply manage to play the game easily

       -Dependencies:
       
       * Currently, the HTML snippets plugin for WordPress is a big dependency because without it we wouldn't be able to show the          modules within the site.



#### Test Item Pass/Fail Criteria:

* Test to see if all the games work:
  * Test will pass if no errors come up during the running of the game. Alternatively, test will fail if errors occur and game renders unplayable.
* Test to see if all the button works
  * Test will pass if all buttons do intended action. Test will fail if button reacts differently than expected
    * Game button - activate games
    * Next button - directs to next section/chapter
    * Back button - driects to previous section/chapter
    * Exit button - closes current application
    * Submit button - submits the work

* Test to see if the website can be shown on any web browser
  * Test will pass if website will show up on major browsers. Test will fail if the enitre page does not appear in the browser.
    * Chrome
    * Firefox
    * Internet Explorer
    * Safari
* Test to see if the website can be shown on any device (such as tablets, smart phones and laptop computers)
  *Test will pass if website can be shown on screens larger than 7 inches. Test will fail if website will not appear on screen.
    * Android Tablet 7 inches and larger
    * iPad 7 inches and larger
    * Laptop/Computer screen (see browser test)


Test Deliverables:

       -Test Reports

 

## Part II:  User Testing Plan

 

There are two parts to user testing:  Examining the interface from the point of view of the user, namely Heuristic Evaluation or using the Checklist, and doing actual user testing, with real users either examining the interface or actually trying to get a test-task done.

 

Your plan for HE/Checklist should be preparing the interface materials (mockups, wireframes, GTN) and then having a session with your team going through the tasks one by one examining the points in the Heuristics or the Checklist.  So you need to plan for the materials, having the checklists available, then recording your “findings.”  You then meet to decide what changes to make in the interface and put those on the sprint.

 

For actual user testing, you have to plan for the kind of user you will recruit and how many, when the sessions will be, what tasks you will ask them to do, what interface they will use, how you will record their actions and evaluations (e.g. a quick survey), and when you will take your findings and make changes to the interface.  Those planned design changes appear on a sprint.
